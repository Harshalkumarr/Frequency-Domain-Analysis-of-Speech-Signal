# Frequency-Domain-Analysis-of-Speech-Signal
  The problem of speech recognition is addressed using Wavelet Transform as a means to match phonemes from speech signal.Speech recognition system generally carry out some kind of classification/recognition based upon speech features which are usually obtained via Fourier Transform.
  Fourier Transform gives frequency domain information of a signal,which means that it tells us how much of each frequency exists in signal.But it does not tell us when in time these frequency components exists i.e. we do not get frequency value at particular time period.This information is not required when signal is so-called stationary. Signal whose frequency component do not change in time are called stationary signal.
  Speech signal is time varying signal i.e. Non-stationary signal (frequency response varies with time).Fourier transform can be used for non-stationary signal if we are interested in **"which spectral components exists in signal"** but **"not interested in where these occur"**.
  One way to obtain time frequency information of signal is use of **Short Time Fourier Transform STFT**.But there is also problem of STFT.STFT gives time-frequency information but it gives it only for fixed interval of time i.e. STFT gives such info for fixed window.
  Wavelet Transform (WT) gives variable resolution.Higher frequencies are better resolved in time and lower frequencies are better resolved in frequency.This means , acertain high frequency components can be better located in time (with less relative error) than a low frequency component.
